* Have created a paginated report for conversion of sales invoice to pdf and for printing out for circulation.
* Created decomposition tree for performing root cause analysis and exploratory analysis of each key indicator and breaking down a measure across multiple dimensions.
* Also I have uploaded the report to PBI service, created a dashboard in service. 
* Set-up scheduled refresh and set-up Row Level Security and managed roles to restrict data access for specific users in workspaces.
